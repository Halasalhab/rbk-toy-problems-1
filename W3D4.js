/*
1-Write a function called tallEnoughToRide  that takes an array of people objects, 
and returns a an array of names of people who are greater than or equal to 48 inches in height.
You can assume an input which looks like this:
Calling your function should result in:
tallEnoughToRide(groupA); //["Mia", "Kiana", "Alex"];
Remember: your function should work off of the data it receives, 
not a global variable or only the specific example above. 
I.e. If someone called your function with 10 objects 
(with all safely have the same properties), it should work just as well.
